  // Since this is one component and it's being used in a map, the parent
  // component's ref array logic is still needed for the glow effect to work
  // across all instances. However, for a clean component, we'll assume the
  // ref handling for the glow effect is managed externally or simplify the ref.
  // Since your original 'GlowCard' was storing refs in an array via the parent,
  // we'll keep that assumption and make a slight adjustment.

  // --- Simplified Ref Management for Clarity ---
  // In a real-world scenario, if you use the ref prop like this:
  // <GlowCard ref={(el) => (cardRefs.current[index] = el)} ...>
  // ...you would pass the ref from the parent. Since you're using 'useRef'
  // *inside* the mapped component, it's problematic for a global array.
  // The original component's ref logic was flawed for mapping, but we'll use a
  // local ref to make this component functional individually.
